Making a git repo for this project. Not really sure how to organize this all tbh. Here's the story: after trying a few different productivity methods, agendas, planners, etc, I decided I needed to make my own ✨special✨ artistic planner. And it looks like all the things exactly as I want. Making a git repo 1: to keep things organized because I am a freak and need all my files in order and yet this project, which I've been using since like October last year I think, is always getting ~updated~ remade in new places on new deceives. and 2: because a friend has also started using them so :^) hi J.
