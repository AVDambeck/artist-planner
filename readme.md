# Planners By Artists For Artists!

I'm an artist who didn't like any of the available planner options. I make my own. Feel free to [copy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTybKL1pM4) my work. 

## Assembly.

Okay so this is pageset on [bookbinder3.0](http://www.quantumelephant.co.uk/bookbinder/bookbinder.html) for letter paper on a duplux printer. Print it out in a lil booklet, fold it in half. Get a piece of card thats like 9x13" ish. Staple it like in the examples. Add postits to the front. Add a pocket to the back. Add tape to the front to label it. Cut a hole for a mechanical pencil. Add a binder clip and voila!

## Usage.

I last weekly schedual for my regular weekly commitments (school, work, gym, clubs, study, etc), and the second to last for other peoples availabilty, facility hours, etc. Then I use the calendar as a calendar. Each week I fill out a schedual for it of what I acually plan to do and stuff. Then I do it.

## Example.
